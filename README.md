# Flight Analysis Application using R

This project is component 2 of my course Visualisation, and is a continuation of my project [Flight_Delays_Analysis](https://github.com/ialok00001/Filght_Delays_Analysis), which was the component 1 of the same course. In this project, I have created an app using RShiny, using the same dataset and hape deployed it on RShiny.io. In this, I have included several interactive graphs and visualizations where one can toggle the highlighted parameters in many combinations to attain sevaral graphs, which one can use to perform a visual Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on flight delays and their trends, flights ranked my popularity and flights ranked by average delay time.

Please do check the application [here](https://turbo-genesis.shinyapps.io/R_Shiny_app/).
